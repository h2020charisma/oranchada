# oranchada
[Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/) workflow add-on for processing [Raman spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy). Based on [ramanchada2](https://github.com/h2020charisma/ramanchada2).


## Installation

**UPDATE**: This guide used to suggest using the standalone installer of Orange. It is now recommended to use the portable version of Orange instead, which helps to avoid some possible incompatibilities.

1. Depending on your operating system:

    1. **Windows**: Download the *Portable Orange* ZIP from https://orangedatamining.com/download/#windows and extract it to some place from which it will be convenient for you to start it. If you are not sure about the place, just extract it to your desktop (it will be possible to move it later if you change your mind). To run Portable Orange, open the shortcut. On the first run, there might be a security warning. In this case, unselect **Always ask before opening this file** and click **Open**.

    2. **Linux**: Use the instructions in https://orangedatamining.com/download/#linux. However, we strongly recommend creating a separate environment (i.e. not the base one) if using Conda or a venv if using pip.

    1. **macOS**: Not tested; the instructions from https://orangedatamining.com/download/#macos should work. Feedback welcome.

1. Once it's installed and running, open **Options** ‚û°Ô∏è **Add-ons**. Note the "Orange Update Available" notification in the lower right corner that may show up at times. Do **not** click download. Refer to the [updating](#updating) section below for more information.

1. Click the **Add more...** button.

### Manual installation

If your network connection has very tight security that severely restricts what sites you can access, the usual installation method via **Options** ‚û°Ô∏è **Add-ons** might not work for you. It may be possible to circumvent the problem by installing *oranchada* manually:

1. Open https://pypi.org/project/oranchada/#files and download the "Built Distribution" `.whl` file.
1. Open **Options** ‚û°Ô∏è **Add-ons** then drag & drop the downloaded `.whl` file to the add-ons window.
1. Proceed with the general instructions above, starting from step 5 ("scroll down the list until you find **oranchada**").

## Updating

1. Open **Options** ‚û°Ô∏è **Add-ons**. If there's a new version of *oranchada* or *Orange* itself, they will be listed at the top, with your installed version and the latest available one indicated (e.g. you have `0.0.6` installed and `0.0.7` is the latest available version that you can update to).

1. Click the box(es) next to the available updates so that a check mark appears and *Update* is displayed in the **Action** column, then click **OK**.

1. If *Orange* itself has an update in addition to *oranchada*, take note that:

    1. An additional warning will be displayed. Click **OK**.

    2. **IMPORTANT**: In case the upgrade fails, click **OK** and repeat the steps above‚Äîit should work on the second attempt. Do **NOT** close *Orange* here without repeating the steps! If you do this, you will most likely not be able to start *Orange* again and will have to install it anew from the beginning, possibly losing some of your settings.
